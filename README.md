The app that I have created is an app designed for any user. Its purpose is to act as a Tanmagotchi app. The application is amazingly simple. The front page will have a button which when clicked, will go to the second page. On said second page, you have three buttons, one being a feed button, a clean button and a play button. They all do their names function. When one of these buttons have been clicked by the user, it will give an update of how the dog feels.
